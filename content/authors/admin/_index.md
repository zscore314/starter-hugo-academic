I am a P&C Actuary (FCAS, MAAA) and consultant with broad experience in the (re)insurance industry. I'm passionate about quantifying risk and using data to make better decisions. In my current role, I create value for clients by providing capital solutions and analytical support to help them manage volatility, protect their balance sheet, and meet their financial objectives.
  
I have a passion for building models and learning, especially in the fields of probability & statistics, finance and risk. When I am not reading, I enjoy football, (strong) coffee and vacationing with my family.
