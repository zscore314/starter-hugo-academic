I recently picked up the book [Mathletics](https://www.amazon.com/Mathletics-Gamblers-Managers-Mathematics-Sports-dp-0691177627/dp/0691177627/) by Wayne Winston after hearing a recommendation in an online R meetup. The book's tagline: "How gamblers, managers, and fans use mathematics in sports."

The first chapter "Baseball's Pythagorean Theorem" describes a mathematical relationship to estimate the percentage games won in baseball, attributed to Bill James. 

{{< math >}}
`$$\text{% games won} = \frac{\text{runs scored}^2} {\text{runs scored}^2 + \text{runs allowed }^2}$$`
